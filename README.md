## üìñ Description

Fast & Furious with Self Drive AI is an autonomous driving system that combines camera (and optional LiDAR) input with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) bicycle model to achieve high-speed lane following and obstacle avoidance. Building on prior research that demonstrated safe but slow self-driving, this project aims to push the performance envelope by increasing speed while maintaining safety.
