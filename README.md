## üìñ Description

Fast & Furious with Self Drive AI is an autonomous driving system that combines camera (and optional LiDAR) input with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) bicycle model to achieve high-speed lane following and obstacle avoidance. Building on prior research that demonstrated safe but slow self-driving, this project aims to push the performance envelope by increasing speed while maintaining safety.

## üóÇÔ∏è Codebase Structure

- **controllers/**: Contains the control algorithms for the vehicle. The two main controllers are:
  - `PID.py`: Implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller for basic motion control.
  - `MPC.py`: Implements a Model Predictive Control (MPC) bicycle model for advanced trajectory planning and control.

- **scripts/road_follower_scripts/road_follower.py**: This is the main JetRacer script that runs the self-driving pipeline.
  - It utilizes `road_follower_class.py` for the core logic and methods.
  - The trained neural network model used for road following is stored at `scripts/road_follower_scripts/trained_models/updated_model_trt.pth`.

This structure separates control logic from the main application, making it easier to maintain and extend the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/40401789/fast-and-furious-with-self-drive-ai.git
   cd fast-furious-self-drive-ai
   ```
2. Install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the JetRacer hardware and software environment as per the [JetRacer setup guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/l4t-archive-r34_1_1/index.html).

## üöÄ Usage

To start the self-driving demo, run the following command:  
```bash
python3 scripts/road_follower_scripts/road_follower.py
```

Ensure that the JetRacer is on a flat surface and has enough space to drive around before starting the demo.
