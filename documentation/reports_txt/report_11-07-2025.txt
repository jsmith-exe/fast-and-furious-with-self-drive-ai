Brief Report

Project Name: 

Supervisor: Yun Wu

Student: Jamie Smith

Date: 11/07/2025

Plan: 11/07/2025:
1.	Configure parameters for real life MPC
2.	Improve simulation by including simulated camera values as MPC input
Brief Report (any progress, thoughts, and development achievements): 

1.	Achieved 2.56x Faster Line Following – Line following at 2.56x speeds using a tuned PID controller.
2.	Video Recording – Recorded and edited a progress video to highlight the speed increase achieved.
3.	MPC Line Following Simulation – Developed line following using a model predictive controller within a Python simulation.
4.	File Efficiency – All road following files, with the exception of one model training file, have now been converted to Python instead of Jupyter notebooks. This has led to faster load times.
