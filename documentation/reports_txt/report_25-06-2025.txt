Brief Report

Project Name: 

Supervisor: Yun Wu

Student: Jamie Smith

Date: 25/06/2025

Plan: 20/06/2025-
1. Calibrate the sensor, especially the camera (hint: how to save the calibration setting in ROS):
       JetRacer_ROS_AI_Kit_Tutorial_VIII:_Start_the_Camera_Node
       JetRacer_ROS_AI_Kit_Tutorial_VII:_Robot_Odometer_Calibration
2. Obstacle avoidance (hint: how is the state machine pipeline working):
       Using camera only: 
       Using fused camera & LiDar
3. Identify the place where the PID code is implemented and think about how it can be replaced by MPC (hint: under stand the input/output of the controller)

Brief Report (any progress, thoughts, and development achievements): 

1. Line-following achieved: The robot now reliably tracks the path at slow speeds via the camera module. Image-processing latency is still apparent, so the plan to integrate an MPC controller to sustain higher speeds is clear.
2. GitLab: I next need to setup a GitLab repository to document progress and store any files I modify.
3. Obstacle-avoidance refinement: With the repository in place, I'll revisit the two prior avoidance strategies.
Questions (any concerns related to development, progress, or supports): 
1.
